# family_reader

Home schooling parents and home schooled independent readers often have to grapple with finding suitable, challenging and varied reading materials. When trying to discover reading materials, they are typically on their own, or only have access to a limited number of other home schooling parents for recommendations. Even then, they normally don't have access to those other parents at the time when they need the advice

This application, The Family Reader, will provide to them a curated list of titles that will cover all reading levels and many useful genres/subject categories. It will be available online, so they will never be constrained by time or by availability of access to resource persons.

The idea came from a printed list of recommended books prepared and circulated by home schooling families. It was not available online initially, and few knew about it. Although it was subsequently put online in the mid-90's, it was--and remains--essentially non-interactive. Further, the titles are hard-coded into the HTML, which is inefficient.
